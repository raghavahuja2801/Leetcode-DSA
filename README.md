# Leetcode Solutions - My Journey to Mastering Data Structures and Algorithms

Welcome to my Leetcode solutions repository! This is a place where I document and share my journey of solving problems related to data structures and algorithms. The goal is not only to learn but also to grow consistently in problem-solving and to become proficient at tackling a variety of algorithmic challenges.

## Why This Repository Exists

Leetcode is an excellent platform for practicing and improving your problem-solving skills, but consistency is key to making real progress. By solving problems daily and continuously challenging myself, I aim to cover a wide range of topics such as arrays, strings, dynamic programming, graphs, and more. This repository will serve as a personal log of the problems I have solved, their solutions, and the learning I gain along the way.

Each problem I solve has its own folder with a solution in the form of a code file, along with a brief explanation of the approach and logic behind the solution.

## Key Takeaways
- **Consistency is key**: By solving problems every day, you'll notice significant improvement over time.
- **Growth mindset**: Embrace challenges, learn from failures, and improve your strategies.
- **Learning never stops**: Keep experimenting with new approaches and stay curious about optimizing solutions.


# Streak
- To hold myself accountable I have this streak that keeps track of my consistency.
