# Leetcode Solutions - My Journey to Mastering Data Structures and Algorithms

Welcome to my Leetcode solutions repository! This is a place where I document and share my journey of solving problems related to data structures and algorithms. The goal is not only to learn but also to grow consistently in problem-solving and to become proficient at tackling a variety of algorithmic challenges.

## Why This Repository Exists

Leetcode is an excellent platform for practicing and improving your problem-solving skills, but consistency is key to making real progress. By solving problems daily and continuously challenging myself, I aim to cover a wide range of topics such as arrays, strings, dynamic programming, graphs, and more. This repository will serve as a personal log of the problems I have solved, their solutions, and the learning I gain along the way.

Each problem I solve has its own folder with a solution in the form of a code file, along with a brief explanation of the approach and logic behind the solution.

## Key Takeaways
- **Consistency is key**: By solving problems every day, you'll notice significant improvement over time.
- **Growth mindset**: Embrace challenges, learn from failures, and improve your strategies.
- **Learning never stops**: Keep experimenting with new approaches and stay curious about optimizing solutions.


# Streak
- To hold myself accountable I have this streak that keeps track of my consistency.

## Important Algorithms

This section highlights key algorithms implemented during my LeetCode journey. They are organized into separate folders based on algorithm types, such as sorting, searching, and more. Each folder contains well-documented solutions with explanations for better understanding.

### ðŸ“‚ Categories

- **[Sorting Algorithms](./Sorting/)**  
  Explore classic sorting techniques like Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and Cycle Sort. These implementations cover both basic concepts and optimization strategies.

- **[Searching Algorithms](./Searching/)**  
  Dive into efficient searching methods like Binary Search and its variations. Learn how to approach problems with O(log n) complexity and handle edge cases.

- **[Greedy Algorithms](./Greedy/)**  
  Practical solutions to problems involving optimization by making locally optimal choices at each step. Includes examples like interval scheduling and minimum cost problems.

- **[Dynamic Programming (DP)](./Dynamic_Programming/)**  
  Comprehensive solutions for DP problems. This includes tabulation, memoization, and strategies to optimize both time and space complexity.

- **[Graph Algorithms](./Graph/)**  
  Implementations of graph traversal techniques like BFS and DFS, as well as shortest path algorithms such as Dijkstra's and Bellman-Ford.

- **[Backtracking](./Backtracking/)**  
  Learn how to systematically explore all possibilities for solving problems like permutations, combinations, and n-queens.

- **[Divide and Conquer](./Divide_and_Conquer/)**  
  Solutions that showcase how to break problems into smaller subproblems and solve them efficiently, such as in Merge Sort and Quick Sort.

- **[Mathematical Algorithms](./Mathematics/)**  
  Techniques for problems involving number theory, such as GCD, LCM, modular arithmetic, and more.

### ðŸ“œ Features

- Each algorithm includes a clear explanation of its logic and a step-by-step walkthrough of the code.
- Edge cases are handled explicitly to ensure robust solutions.
- Complexity analysis (time and space) is provided for each implementation.
